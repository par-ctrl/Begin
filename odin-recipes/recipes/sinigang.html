            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A mix of tender meat, fresh spinach, string beans, and tomatoes, as well as a dash (or more) of savory
                fish sauce, make for the perfect combination in simmering and incorporating each unique flavor with each
                other. Powerful and poignant, sinigang is a Filipino native, through and through. Its name, sinigang,
                originates from the Tagalog verb that directly translates to “to stew” — sigang! Because of its Tagalog
                name, many presume it to be Tagalog in origin as well. This yummy meal has relatives in other regions in
                the country as well, to be sure — yet none are quite like this classic soup that many have fallen in
                love with.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Boil the young tamarind in 2 quarts of water for 40 minutes. Filter the tamarind broth using a kitchen sieve or a strainer. Squeeze the tamarind afterwards to extract its remaining juices.</li>
                <li>Pour the tamarind broth into a cooking pot. Let it boil and then add the onion, pork belly, and half the amount of the tomatoes.</li>
                <li>Skim-off the floating scums, pour 1 tablespoon fish sauce, cover and continue to simmer for 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Add daikon radish and eggplants. Cook for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the long green pepper, string beans, remaining tomatoes, and okra. Cook for 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped water spinach stalks and season with fish sauce and ground black pepper. Cook for 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Put the water spinach leaves. Cover and turn the heat off. Let the residual heat cook the leaves for 3 minutes before serving.</li>
            </ol>
