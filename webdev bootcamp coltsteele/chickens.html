    <h1>Chicken</h1>
    <p>The <b>chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus)</b> is a large and round short-winged <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird">bird</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication_of_vertebrates">domesticated</a> from the red
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl">junglefowl</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia">Southeast Asia</a> around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs; others are kept as pets[1] or for cockfighting.</p>
    <p>Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 26.5 billion as of 2023, and an
        annual production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. There
        are numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore, religion, and literature.</p>

    <p>Chicken can mean a chick, and this was historically the meaning of the word chicken,[16] as in William
        Shakespeare's play Macbeth, where Macduff laments the death of "all my pretty chickens and their dam".[17] The
        usage is preserved in placenames such as the Hen and Chicken Islands.[18] In older sources, and still often in
        trade and scientific contexts, chickens as a species are described as common fowl or domestic fowl.[19]</p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in most breeds,
        and the wings are short.[20] Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow
        them to fly more than a short distance.[21] Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[20] Newly-hatched
        chicks of both modern and heritage varieties weigh the same, about 37 g (1.3 oz). Modern varieties however grow
        much faster; by day 35 a Ross 708 broiler may weigh 1.8 kg (4.0 lb) as against the 1.05 kg (2.3 lb) of a
        heritage chicken of the same age.[22]</p>
